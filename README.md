# CHIP-8 Emulator

_A CHIP-8 Emulator and Interpreter_

----

This project is being used for pedagogical purposes to teach the C ecosystem in the context of a small (and hopefully interesting) project.

The goal of this project will be to capture some of the initial development path towards building a C project from scratch. First will be getting some simple logic in place in the form of a C module. The simplest possible commands to compile this project into an executable will be put in place. Then the project will begin to take on a more traditional structure in terms of its directories. Those simplest possible commands will morph into a makefile. That, in turn, will morph into a cross-platform development with CMake. There are separate [development notes](https://github.com/jeffnyman/chip8_emulator_c/blob/main/README.DEV.md) for the evolution of the project.
